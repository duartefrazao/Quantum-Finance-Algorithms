# Quantum Finance Algorithms

Quantum algorithms applied to a Portfolio Management problem.
Developed an improved version of the traditional QAOA algorithm that provides the following advantages:
- A speedup in execution time
- Reduction of the state space to the set of feasible states
- Possibility to add complex constraints that do not fit the penalty term model, such as, binary encoding and sector allocation.
